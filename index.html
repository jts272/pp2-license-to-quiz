    <p>Your mission is a multiple choice quiz. You will be given a question with 3 possible answers. Select the correct answer and move on to the next one.</p><br>
    <p>You have a choice of difficulties. The easier the mission, the fewer then questions. We'll also provide you with more support.</p><br>
    <p>Q Branch has developed a device to make things easier for you. Select the 50/50 to rule out one wrong answer. Don't count on this on harder missions though...</p><br>
    <p>Once you've reached the end, submit your name to the leaderboards or try a harder mission. Have you got all that, Agent?</p><br>
