Need I remind you, 007, that you have a license to quiz?

This documentation covers an interactive front-end web application in quiz format, based on the world of James Bond 007. As this historic, storied franchise celebrates its 60th year, this app serves as way for fans to test their knowledge in an engaging way.

The technologies used to power this quiz consist of HTML5, CSS3 and pure JavaScript. These technologies will be used in conjunction to create a responsive site wherein users can engage with elements in a fun, intuitive way.

## User Experience

(what the user experience is intended to be. include different perspectives, user stories)

This application is designed for fans of the James Bond 007 franchise. It tests the user's knowledge to varying degrees of difficulty.

The site is fast, responsive and intuitive. The flow of the site is evident on the homepage, with call-to-action buttons for the user to navigate. Game rules are shown via a modal to inform the player how to proceed with game flow.

Accessibility through contrast and appropriate HTML feature usage affords a consistent site experience to users.

This application has been built as a natural extension from the 007 franchise's online presence. [007.com](https://www.007.com/) was referenced as a starting point for the user's expectations. As we will explore, the app's presentation is in keeping with these established, expected traditions.

### User Stories

Here we examine the intention of the site. Client perspective refers to the license holders of the intellectual property.

- Client Goals:
  - To provide entertainment for franchise fans
  - To project a visual impression in-keeping with fan expectations
  - For users to engage with the IP

- First Time Visitor Goals:
  - To find site navigation evident
  - To have a great first impression of site presentation
  - To play their first quiz game

- Returning Visitor Goals:
  - To play the quiz game at a harder level
  - To view target scores, which they would aim to beat

## Design Process

The strategy of this app is to entertain fans of 007. As a quiz format, questions were created to target 3 different levels of knowledge. They are made from trivia throughout different stages of history of the Bond filmography.

Fans know Bond as a smooth, suave spy and this was to be reflected throughout the site's practical elements. These details will be explored in their relevant sections below.

Project scope determined what features were in and out. In this project, it was key to focus on the [minimal viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP). At its core, this quiz app must contain:
 - Rules of play
 - A selection of difficulties, with unique question sets
 - A scoreboard to encourage user performance
 - Feedback to the user for all actions
 - Intuitive navigation system to tie the experience together

This project in particular relied on a programming language to handle site interactivity. I bore in mind the minimum required features that must be implemented as my understanding of JavaScript grew with the project.

For site structure, brief instruction is given to the user, followed by interactive buttons to perform their labelled action. The header and body are responsively styled with a mobile-first approach. This ensures that regardless of device, relevant content is readily accessible and the user is never stuck.

At the skeleton level, the site content is displayed on 'cards' that hold the text content and interactive elements of the site. This sits on a grey background. At the desktop level, this background transforms to a minimalist black and white shot of various Bonds throughout the years, which vary by page. This reinforces the suave image of the franchise, whilst reminding users of its legacy.

On the surface plane of design, the practical elements combine to project an image and tone that fans have come to expect. As well as films, there are many popular video games for this IP which have a well-established tone for the franchise in terms of interactive entertainment.

User instruction is delivered in a manner that the user (or 'Agent'!) might expect from the character of 'Q' in a briefing session. Messaging is concise, yet functional and addresses the user as if they were in-character as a secret agent embarking on a mission.

## Practical Elements

### Typography

[007.com](https://www.007.com/) was used as a springboard for the visual appearance of this app. Upon inspection, I found that heading elements used 'Futura' font and body text used 'Georgia'. The latter was a common web-safe font. I was unable to find Futura on Google Fonts, however [this blog post](https://www.naomi-maria.com/5-free-alternatives-for-futura-on-google-fonts/) let to me importing the 'Jost' font for an almost identical match.

### Colour

Much like the official website, I opted for a minimalist, understated use of colour. The expected black and white of the iconic tuxedo was highlighted with gold - another colour famously associated with Bond. A neutral grey was used as the body background. The hex value for gold was used directly on the website. The grey shade came from the colour picker in MS Paint for the Daniel Craig background image.

### Wireframes

My process for page layout design is to firstly sketch on paper the layout and content. From there, I recreate these drafts in [Balasmiq.](https://balsamiq.com/)

These designs serve as a guide for the general appearance of the page. By using a mobile-first design strategy, these layouts were naturally scaleable to desktop view. The Bond background images were added to the desktop UX to help set the mood and add visual interest.

Due to the iterative nature of this project, some elements on the wireframe plans my not be represented in the deployed product.
